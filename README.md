Castle FS
=========
_A versioned object store (with linux vfs interface) prototype using Stratified B-trees._

Initially developed by a now defunct (supposedly consumed by Apple Inc.) company Acunu, apparently abandoned
and released under GPL v2.

[Stratified B-trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4282) offer promise of much better sustained performance and
storage utilization then the usual COW B-trees, so the code hereby should better be kept around for analysis
and study.
